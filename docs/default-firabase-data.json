I will share our research driven as well industry collaboration effort for supporting developers to describe, predict, and possible prescribe their development behaviors on aPaaS. Novelty in our work is to employ all metadata actions recorded on aPaaS (that is, digital trace for software development) and model them as a complex system using graph theory, which is successfully employed in network science. I’ll show with a real life software development case on aPaaS where the developer’s behavior is characterized with signature patternsthat can be associated with some best practices and/or software engineering patterns. Network science approach to developer behavior analysis utilizing digital trace data may eventually help us to radically change the way of thinking and working for software development.",

If you use it correctly, it dramatically increases productivity of developers and eliminates the waste products continuously. Developers cultivate a development culture on top Git most of the time.<br><br>It's powerful but its power is untamed. Many teams fall into several traps of misusing commands and therefore feel uncomfortable while using Git. We mess up Git history, the codebase and the whole preferred branching strategy in seconds. We use branches, merge/rebase strategies, creating commits in wrong ways. Even we never take committing paradigms into account while using Git.<br><br>As a software craftsman, I've been using Git for years and I've already educated Git to hundreds of developers in all levels. I'm so lucky; I had a chance to experience huge amount of anti-patterns in time. In this talk, I will talk about what those anti-patterns are and what should we do in order not to fall into them.",
