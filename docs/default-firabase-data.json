I will share our research driven as well industry collaboration effort for supporting developers to describe, predict, and possible prescribe their development behaviors on aPaaS. Novelty in our work is to employ all metadata actions recorded on aPaaS (that is, digital trace for software development) and model them as a complex system using graph theory, which is successfully employed in network science. I’ll show with a real life software development case on aPaaS where the developer’s behavior is characterized with signature patternsthat can be associated with some best practices and/or software engineering patterns. Network science approach to developer behavior analysis utilizing digital trace data may eventually help us to radically change the way of thinking and working for software development.",
